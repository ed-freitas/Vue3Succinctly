# Vue 3 Succinctly (Vue 3 + Vite template)

This repo contains the code for the demo application of the book `Vue 3 Succinctly` from Syncfusion.

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

This project also uses Firebase, so please edit the firebase.js file within the project's root folder, and make sure your Firebase set up is ready.

Don't forget to install any dependencies by running the `npm install` command from the built-in terminal within VS Code before running the application.

To run the app in dev mode, use the `npm run dev` command.
