# Vue 3 Succinctly (Vue 3 + Vite template)

This repo contains the code for the demo application of the `Vue 3 Succinctly` book from Syncfusion.

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs; check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

This project also uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), so please edit the `firebase.js` file within the project's root folder and ensure your Firebase setup is ready.

Don't forget to install any dependencies by running the `npm install` command from the built-in terminal within VS Code before running the application.

To run the app in dev mode, use the `npm run dev` command.
